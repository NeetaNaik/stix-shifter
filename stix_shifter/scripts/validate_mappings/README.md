## Generate STIX Cyber Observable Schema

This script uses a function named `generate_stix_cybox_json` that generates a JSON file containing a list of all the STIX Cyber Observable objects and their properties. The function uses the `stix2.v20` module to get a list of all the objects in the module's namespace. The function then filters out any objects that are not legitimate STIX Cyber Observable objects, such as objects that start with an underscore (_). The function then uses a regular expression to convert the object names from camel case to hyphenated lower case. The function then adds the filtered objects to a dictionary, where the key is the STIX cyber observable object name and the value is a list of the object's properties. Lastly, the function then writes the JSON string to a file named `stix_cyber_observables.json`.

### Requirements

`stix2` python library

### Usage

`python generate_stix_cybox_schema.py`
